You are improving my existing frontend UI. Do NOT change the file/folder structure, imports, routing system, or core logic. Only modify the UI components and page layout.

Your goals:

1. Detect all sections, pages, or components that currently appear on the home screen but do NOT open as separate pages. Convert each one into its own dedicated page file using the existing routing system.

2. For each page, create a premium, expensive-looking UI inspired by ModelML:
   • ultra-clean layout
   • large whitespace
   • sharp typography
   • smooth shadows and depth
   • subtle premium micro-interactions
   • clean card blocks with soft gradients
   • fade/slide transitions for page loads
   • minimalistic icons
   • elegant spacing strategy

3. Update the home page so that every feature block, section card, and action button correctly navigates to its new dedicated page.

4. On each page, add a top header + title + description just like ModelML. For example:
   “Cleo.ai Workflows — turn raw clinic data into fully automated AI pipelines.”

5. Improve the design of every block:
   • make the buttons premium-quality
   • add hover animations
   • add soft borders and glassy surfaces
   • use a luxury color palette (black, white, platinum gray, soft gradients)
   • keep everything extremely clean and professional
   • maintain a consistent design language across all pages

6. Do NOT break any existing code. Do NOT remove any imports. Do NOT modify API call structures. Only update UI and navigation.

7. Keep the brand and wording consistent with “Cleo.ai”.
   Replace any old names or placeholders.

8. Ensure each page has a consistent structure:
   • Hero section with title + subtitle
   • Feature cards or workflow blocks
   • Clean container width (max-w-7xl)
   • Good spacing (py-20, px-8, etc.)
   • Smooth animation wrappers

9. Make sure the navigation bar includes links to all new pages.

10. After finishing, ensure the app still builds and runs without errors.

Now apply these changes to the entire project. Provide updated React component code, routing updates, improved UI styling, and all new page files.
