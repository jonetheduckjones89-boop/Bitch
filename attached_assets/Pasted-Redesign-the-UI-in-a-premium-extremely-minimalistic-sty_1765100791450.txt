Redesign the UI in a premium, extremely minimalistic style inspired directly by ModelML, under the new product name “Cleo.ai”.

The design must feel purposeful, consistent, and created by a senior designer over months — clean, spaced, calm, and high-end.  
No flashy elements. No over-decoration. Everything must have intention and function.

Remove the Pricing page entirely.

Ensure:
- every section on the homepage has its own dedicated page  
- every button performs a specific, meaningful task  
- the “empty block” on the homepage is filled with realistic customer quotes about Cleo.ai (similar to ModelML)  
- clean white/grey/blue palette  
- soft corners (12–16px)  
- very subtle gradients  
- quiet micro-animations only  
- thin typographic hierarchy similar to ModelML
